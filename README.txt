Notes:

This version of Screenstagram compiles against an unknown version of the dev branch of Cinder. It should be updated to a more recent version before use.

Local cinder location: it is expected to exist in a folder named 'cinder' in the same directory as this file, normally symbolically linked there.

The vc10 folder actually contains a vc11 (Visual Studio 2012) project solution now. It is setup to link against the v110_xp toolset.
